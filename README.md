# experiments

Check it out [here](https://afternoon-oasis-58074.herokuapp.com/). Currently using a free Heroku dyno so will take 30 seconds to boot up.

### What

This is a place for me to play around with new technologies and try new things without overthinking it too much. If something sounds fun, interesting and challenging, I might try it here.

Future: Might try to make tutorials for the ones that are popular

### Mini-experiments

[Hello👋](https://afternoon-oasis-58074.herokuapp.com/hello): My first experiment. A log book for anyone who visits to leave a comment.

### Idea

Turn Drawing into a simpe paint app. Can download images at any time and create blank canvas

Input a URL, display all images from that page. 
- Can also download images to desktop or a folder.
- Might need to spawn a python process for BS4 library. [Reference](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23450534/how-to-call-a-python-function-from-node-js)
