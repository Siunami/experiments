Check it out [here](https://afternoon-oasis-58074.herokuapp.com/). Currently using a free Heroku dyno so will take 30 seconds to boot up.

### What

This is a place for me to play around with new technologies and try new things without overthinking it too much. If something sounds fun, interesting and challenging, I might try it here.

Future: Might try to make tutorials for the ones that are popular
